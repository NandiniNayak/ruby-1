# Advanced:
# * We have done a Fibonacci challenge in the past, time to met his sister, Tribonacci
# * Tribonacci will take the last 3 inputs (as oppose to 2), and add them together to get another value
# * Create a method that will be given an array and an integer as input. The array will hold the first 3 numbers of the tribonacci sequence, whilst the integer will be the nth number of the sequence we want to access
# E.g. If we pass ([1,1,2], 5) to the method, we should receive the number 7 back (as the sequence would add 1 + 1 + 2 to get 4, so would be [1,1,2,4], so then would add 1 + 2 + 4, and get 7, so would be [1,1,2,4,7], meaning our result would be 7
# * Super hard challenge, but use the skills you have (pseudocode) and team work and youâ€™ll be fine!
tribonacci = [1, 1, 2]
